### FOCUS
 front and mainly backend



### PREFERENCES
there are a lot of commenting i did on lines of code and they are some files i chose not to delete even
when i am not using them.I chose to leave it for a purpose but you can decide to delete those files
if you wishes.


### MOTIVE
 Actually,After going through tutorials and self learning, I was curious about whether 
 I could do Complete Secured Authentications(CSA) because I encountered similar
 content every day on my phone while browsing. It was a challenging experience for me as I was
 still a beginner then.After collecting a lot of ideas and thoughts, I was able to implement it (let's keep the code running).Since then i was able to implement this aleast into 8 WEBSITE that required such functionality. 



### PREREQUISITE
If you are new to PHP and want to clone or download someone else's PHP code, there are a few basic steps and prerequisites you need to be aware of:

1. Development Environment:

---PHP: You need to install PHP on your computer. PHP is a scripting language used for web development. You can download PHP from the official website.
Web Server: PHP is often run on a web server like Apache or Nginx. You may need to install a web server if you don't already have one. You can use an all-in-one package like XAMPP or WAMP to install PHP and a web server at the same time.
Clone or Download the Code:

2. Git: If the code is hosted on a platform like GitHub, you can use Git to clone the repository. First, install Git on your computer, then use the command git clone <repository-url> to clone the code.

---Download ZIP: Alternatively, you can download a ZIP file of the code from the hosting platform and extract it on your computer.

3. Install Dependencies:
---Composer: Many PHP projects use Composer to manage dependencies (libraries the project relies on). You can install Composer from the official website.
Once installed, navigate to the project's root directory and run composer install to install the necessary dependencies.

4. Configure the Project:

---Environment Variables: Some projects use environment variables for configuration. Look for a file called .env and follow the project's documentation to set it up with your specific settings (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
Configuration Files: Check if the project has configuration files (e.g., config.php, settings.php). Update these files with your specific settings if necessary.

5. Set Up a Database:
---If the project uses a database (e.g., MySQL), make sure you have a database server installed and running.
Create a new database and user for the project if required, and import any provided SQL files to set up the database structure.

6. Run the Project:

---Once everything is set up, you can navigate to the project's root directory and start the web server to run the project. If you are using an all-in-one package like XAMPP or WAMP, you can use their control panel to start the server.
Access the project in your web browser by going to http://localhost/<project-directory>.

7. Read the Documentation:

---Check for any README or other documentation provided with the project. It often contains important instructions on how to run and use the code.
These are the basic steps you need to take to get started with cloning or downloading PHP code from other people. As you become more familiar with PHP and web development, you will gain a better understanding of how to configure and work with PHP projects.
